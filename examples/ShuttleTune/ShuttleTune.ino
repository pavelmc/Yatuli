/*
 * Yatuli - (Yet Another Tune Lib)
 * ===============================
 *
 * This lib is inspired in the work of the bitx40 raduino code with a
 * linear volume resistor as tune element instead a quadrature encoder
 *
 * Se here for more details: https://github.com/afarhan/bitx40.git
 *
 * We use a linear volume resistor with extremes connected to GND and +Vcc
 * of the arduino, for stability you must put a 1uF polarized capacitor
 * across GND and +Vcc, then a 10nF (103) capacitor across GND and the wiper
 *
 * The wiper is connected to an Analog input of the Arduino, see the
 * examples with this lib
 *
 * You can get the latest code in this Github repository:
 *
 * https://github.com/pavelmc/yatuli
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * This example simulates a radio dial via serial port, you can see the
 * frequency, ADC value and relative value to ADC center.
 *
 * It's intended to be tested on a Raduino hardware.
